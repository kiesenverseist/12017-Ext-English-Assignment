Texts affect us in very real ways, their impact lasting long after their creation, and in some cases projecting their influence more than a few years.

They ;eave impacts on our perception of modern society, our popular culture and even in areas outside of the texts intended audiences.

Prominent writers like Shakespeare leave tropes that last till today, science fiction authors like Jules Verne still inspire us today.

###The Time Machine
