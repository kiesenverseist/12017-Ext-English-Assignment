# Text Analysis of The Time Machine and Steins Gate

## Narrative Elements

### Summary

| Element | The Time Machine | Steins Gate |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Setting | 1880s London, Utopian future, End of the world | In one city with alternate realities |
| Characters | Nameless, Frame story with the time traveler as the narrator. | Well developed with deep back stories |
| Plot | Observing the future of humanity and the earth | Accidentally making a time machine and changing the past |
| Conflict | Losing his way back to his own time | Traveling far back, undoing his mistakes and the changes he made |
| Resolution | Finds his machine, tells his tale and then disappears | Fixes his mistakes, actually improving the future. |

### Setting
The Book takes place in mainly three settings:
- London  
Thus part of the story takes place in the part of the world that is relatable, just normal London as was known in their time
- The "Utopian" future  
A seemingly idealized future which is later revealed to be much darker than what it may initially seem to be.
- The end of the world  
As he travels far into the future, he observes the slow end of the world, where humanity has had no impact.

### Characters
This is a frame story where **The Narrator** listens to a story told by another (here the Time traveler) and as such is a frame story. As such the narrator is provided very little in the way of character other than being appreciative and mostly accepting of The Time Traveler

**The Time Traveler** is the main character and protagonist of the story, he is the one who builds the machine and uses it to explore the future and by the end of the novel, has disappeared.

The other characters are nameless and mostly serve as sceptics to the time traveler's story.

### Plot
The story lines of both stories are slightly similar but are very different in most aspects. The only similarities that can be actually considered would be the characters foolishly (and without thinking) interfering with time, making mistakes and then try to reverse their mistakes.

### Conflict
The Conflict IS the character's mistakes. The time traveler's mistake lies in his losing of his time machine, while in seins gate the main conflict arise from carless moves by the characters.

### Resolution
Both involve quite resolutions, with the time traveler disappearing after his tale and with the time machine being disposed of in steins gate. They both seem to believe that time traveler isn't something that humans should be able to do.

## Values
### Summary

| Value | The Time Machine | Steins Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Scientific | Is highly valued and the Time traveler uses the scientific method in all his normal dealings | Claims to do as such for science, but has more personal goals |
| Philosophical | Questions the correctness of technological progress | Questions how right it is to leave such power to individuals or larger corporations |
| Religious | None, somewhat looked down upon | Not mentioned, probably unvalued |
| Economic | Technology's affect on the rich and poor, and gaps are explored | The characters are very poor for the entirety of the series, despite their hard work and dedication |

### Scientific
Both stories place a lot of value in the scientific method, and have a lot of faith in what science has to offer. They see technological progress and inevitable but question the morality of certain technological things, how right it is to interfere with other is in steins gate. The time machine more focuses on technological progress as a whole and features a bleak prediction of where it lands humanity.

### Religious
Both texts place no importance on religion, completely omitting them from both of their respective stories.

### Philosophical
Time travel is something that has been philosophized in many ways, paradoxes and other things' are constantly being explored. Steins gate focuses on these time related philosophies but The time traveler actually focuses very little on the implications of time travel, instead more focusing on technology and science in general, and whether it really does help us at all.

### Economic
Steins gate places little value on economic standards, but it is still apparent in how many of it's charters are poor, unable to properly provide for themselves placing blame on their society.

The time machine, on the other hand, explores economic and societal gaps. His final theory on why the future ended up as badly as it did is as follows: The current wealth gap only expanded to the extent where rich people lived a utopic lifestyle to the extent that they devolved to stupidity while the working and lower class were moved underground and were also devolved to cannibalistic spider like monsters. This was all due to technology creating an ever increasing gap in people.
