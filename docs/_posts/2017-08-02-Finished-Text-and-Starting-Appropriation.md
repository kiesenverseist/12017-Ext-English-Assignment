I finished reading my text and I'm glad I chose what I did, the author has some very strong views which are expressed very clearly. The concept of time travel is also nowadays very common making its popular culture impact easy to find.

I have also started on the game. It being a game means it would take more time but I'm still hopeful for the best, It can turn out very well or _very_ bad.
