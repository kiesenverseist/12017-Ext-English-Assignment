I was having many issues with how my site is set up, but just now, I managed to fix them!  
Ill start to work on my analysis as well as continue working on the game. On that note, I have an idea as to the logic of the game, but I'm not completely sure as to what kind of game should be made. I'm not particularly wanting to make  platformer, it also has to be something that can be shown in a short time... I'll work it out somehow.
